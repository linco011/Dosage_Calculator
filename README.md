# Dosage_Calculator
This is another side project that was created to approximate the dosage of 


This document will help the user on how to run this small applet. 

This application will create a graph that will show you the dosage in the body 
Of the patient assuming that the half-life described is exponential. 

Because I wrote this on a Mac, I figured it was not worth creating an executable for use.
Instead the user needs python installed on their system. I would recommend installing the application
Anaconda.

Once installed you may need to install libraries (that are usually preinstalled with anaconda)
The libaries that are needed are:
numpy
matplotlib.pyplot
math

You can install a library by using pip install command. As an example:

pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install math

After installation of python and the libraries, you should be all set to run this application.
To run it open command prompt for windows or terminal for macOS
Go to the directory/Folder by using the cd command where the user is

Examples:
MacOs:

cd /Users/user1/DosageCalculator

Or 
Windows:

cd C:\user1\DosageCalculator

Warning: Path will change depending on where you put this script.

From here you can run python like:

python Dosage_Calculator.py 

This will start the program in your command prompt/terminal
Once it is finished a pop up window will show you the graph of the dosage in the body
By period.
The image will be saved as a png in the folder that you are using to hold the python file. 

Thanks for reading me and hope this works for you :)
